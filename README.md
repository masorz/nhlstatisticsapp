## NHL Statistics App

This project marks my first experience with technologies such as AWS Amplify, Lambda functions, and React. It was developed purely as a learning exercise. My friends and I are passionate NHL fans, and we wanted to explore more advanced statistics beyond what's currently available on nhl.com, which inspired the creation of this project.
API for NHL stats: https://github.com/coreyjs/nhl-api-py
